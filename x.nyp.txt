. Basic Hand Movements in ISL
1.1 Static Signs (One-Handed Gestures)
These signs do not require movement and are used for alphabet letters, numbers, and basic words.

Hello  – Simple wave of the hand.

Yes  – Thumb up.

No  – Index and middle finger move sideways.

Thank You  – Touch fingers to chin and move outward.

Sorry  – Make a fist and rub it in circles on your chest.

1.2 Dynamic Signs (Moving Hand Gestures)
These signs involve hand motion to represent words or phrases.

Come here  – Move your fingers inward toward yourself.

Go there  – Extend your hand forward and point.

Help  – Make a thumbs-up sign and place it on your palm, then move forward.

I don’t know  – Raise both hands and shake head.

What?  – Extend both hands forward and move slightly.

2. Two-Handed Movements in ISL
These involve both hands and sometimes require symmetry or different motions.

Mother  – Open palm near chin, then move outward.

Father  – Open palm near forehead, then move outward.

Eat  – Move fingers toward the mouth.

Drink  – Make a fist and tilt as if drinking from a glass.

I love you  – Extend thumb, index finger, and pinky (ILY sign).

3. Finger Spelling in ISL
For proper names or unknown words, use finger spelling, where each letter has a unique hand sign (similar to ASL alphabet but slightly different).

Examples:
 A to Z in ISL – Use specific finger positions for each letter.
 Numbers (0-9) – Use specific hand shapes.

4. Facial Expressions & Body Language
 Sign language is not just about hands—facial expressions and body movement add meaning.

Raised eyebrows = Question (e.g., "Are you okay?")

Shaking head = Negative response (e.g., "I don’t know")

Nodding head = Agreement ("Yes, I understand")

Leaning forward = Showing interest
